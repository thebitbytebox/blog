In my [previous]({% post_url 2019-08-05-HazelCast%}) blog, we have seen what is the problem that we are trying to solve using hazelcast in our little application [GlucoDiary]({% post_url 2019-07-27-Gluco-Diary%})

As we said in the earlier post we will take the apporach of having embedded hazelcast in user-service.

We added hazelcast spring dependencies to the pom file.

```html
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
   <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-spring</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

If you see, we have not specified any version here in the dependency,. This is because spring has already taken care of it when it sees hazelcast in the dependencies. However, if you need a specific version of hazelcast, you will have to include the version under properties.

```html
<properties>
   <java.version>1.8</java.version>
   <maven.test.skip>true</maven.test.skip>
   <spring-cloud.version>Greenwich.SR1</spring-cloud.version>
   <hazelcast.version>3.11.2</hazelcast.version>
</properties>
```


Springboot does have a default configuration for hazelcast. However, we will override it with our own specification. To do this I have created a configuration class HazelCastConfig.

Note: Hazelcast has both java and xml based configuration and XML based configuration is recommended. However, i am using java in here.


```java
package com.gluco.diary.configs;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

import com.hazelcast.config.Config;
import com.hazelcast.config.EvictionPolicy;
import com.hazelcast.config.ManagementCenterConfig;
import com.hazelcast.config.MapConfig;
import com.hazelcast.config.MaxSizeConfig;

import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;

@Configuration
@Slf4j
public class HazelCastConfig {
	@Value("${token.validity}")
	private Integer timeToLiveInMilliSeconds;
	
	@Value("${token.idle.validity}")
	private Integer idleTimeToLiveInMilliSeconds;
	
	@Value("${hazelcast.mgmt.cent.url}")
	private String managementCenterUrl;
	
	@Value("${HZ_CAST_MGMGT_PASSWORD}")
	private String hzPassword;
	
	
	@Value("${HZ_CAST_MGMGT_USER}")
	private String hzUser;
	
	@Bean
    public Config configureHazlecast(){
	Config config = new Config();
	config.setInstanceName("user-auth-tokens")
	   .addMapConfig(new MapConfig()
		.setName("hz-configuration")
		.setMaxSizeConfig(new MaxSizeConfig(100, MaxSizeConfig.MaxSizePolicy.FREE_HEAP_SIZE))
		.setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy.LRU)
		.setTimeToLiveSeconds(timeToLiveInMilliSeconds/1000)
		.setMaxIdleSeconds(idleTimeToLiveInMilliSeconds/1000));
	
        config.getGroupConfig()
		.setName(hzUser.toString())
		.setPassword(hzPassword.toString());
	ManagementCenterConfig mgmtCentConfig = new ManagementCenterConfig()
					.setUrl(managementCenterUrl)
					.setUpdateInterval(5)
					.setEnabled(true);
	config.setManagementCenterConfig(mgmtCentConfig);

		
		return config;
	}
}
```
we are registering a hazelcast bean in this class. For this we are creating an instance of com.hazelcast.config.Config. In the config we are setting what is the maximum memory allocated to the instance (Policy based on minimum free JVM heap memory in megabytes per JVM).  We have also set an eviction policy of LRU() and also a TTL in seconds.

Eviction policy kicks in when hazelcast run out of memory. When such scenario happens, based on the algorithm specifed, it removes the Least Recently Used to make space for storage. However, we could also specify a time to live in hazelcast, which tells how long an entry can live in memory. If the time exceeds, it will get evicted from memory. However the eviction sampling is done with a fixed interval.

Similarly, we have also specified maxIdle time which limits the lifetime of the entry relative to the time of the last read or write access performed on the entry.

We also have configuration added to enable hazelcast management center. When a node is created, it registers itself in the managment center. Managment centers provides a nice UI to see and monitor our hazelcast instances.

We have delegated the task of getting and adding values into hazelcast to a separate class file UserAuthTokenRepository. This will make sure that if we change the implementation of our IMDG, the only place to make change is UserAuthTokenRepository.

```java
@Component
public class UserAuthTokenRepository {
  private HazelcastInstance hazelCastInstance;
  private static final String USER_TOKEN_MAP = "user-token-map";
  private IMap<String, UserDTO> tokenMap = null;

  @Autowired
  public UserAuthTokenRepository(HazelcastInstance hazelCastInstance) {
     this.hazelCastInstance = hazelCastInstance;
  }

  @PostConstruct
  public void init() {
     tokenMap = hazelCastInstance.getMap(USER_TOKEN_MAP);
  }

  public UserDTO getUserByToken(String token) {
    token = token.replace("Bearer", "").trim();
    return tokenMap.get(token);
  }

  public UserDTO addToken(String token, UserDTO user) {
    token = token.replace("Bearer", "").trim();
    return tokenMap.put(token, user);
  }

  public UserDTO removeToken(String token) {
    token = token.replace("Bearer", "").trim();
    return tokenMap.remove(token);
  }
  ```

  In @Postconstruct( after dependency injection), we are calling


```java
tokenMap = hazelCastInstance.getMap(USER_TOKEN_MAP);
```


This will get the map from our hazelcast instance. If it does not exist, a new map will be created and returned. We will then add our token into this map.

If you see we have used IMap instead of our java Map. IMap is nothing but a map implemention from hazelcast which is Concurrent, distributed, observable and queryable map. However, this violared the Mapâ€™s general contact, which mandated the use of the equals method when comparing object. Instead, IMap implementation compare the serialized byte version of the object. Hence if you are storing objects is the IMap, it should implement Serializable.

Now post login, we no longer saves the token in the database. Instead, now we store it in the hazelcast data grid. Note: we also made some changes to the method signature to pass in the token to the service method together with Principal.

In our JwtTokenProvider class, we now look into the Hazelcast in order to verify our token together with the JWT token validtiy and signature.

We also made some changes to the docker-compose.yml file.

we added hazelcast management center in our docker network. Also, we added a link between management center and user-service.

You also have to set two new environment variables for managment center user and password. This will be injected into the user service via


```
HZ_CAST_MGMGT_PASSWORD: ${HZ_CAST_MGMGT_PASSWORD}
HZ_CAST_MGMGT_USER: ${HZ_CAST_MGMGT_USER}
```

Once you fire up the docker-compose, images will be created and containers will be spun up.

If you want you can scale the user-service to see how new instances of hazlcast gets registered in the management center and how data is distributed and backups are created. To scale user service you can execute.

```
docker-compose scale gluserservice= 2
```

Now, if you login to the hazelcast managment center, you should see the maps and nodes in the console.

Well this concludes my hazelcast post.
