    <p>An IT architect by profession, working for a Fin-Tech Company and with a total of 13+ years of experience in IT industry. I am fortunate to work on different domains with some of the best companies in the world. During my career, I worked on java and related technologies. Never shyed away from learning new technology and always has been upto the challenge. I have been working on AWS for quite sometime and is a cloud enthusiast. My technological expertise include Java, APIs, Elastic Search, AWS Lambdas, Serverless, Cloudformation, gRPC, Kafka, Docker etc. Sometimes, I also dabble with nodejs and angular.</p>

    <p>The main intention of the blog is to walk you through the demo projects that I have been working on. I will try to keep up with the posts. However, I am a newly appointed dad, so no gurantees. I did have an old blog from which I might slowly move contents into this. </p>
